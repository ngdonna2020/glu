# Pseudocode : GLU and its variants in place of traditional activation functions
# -This is a formal pseudocode description based on the paper GLU Variants Improve Transformer by Noam Shazeer (2020). 
# - We can see how the GLU-based feed-forward sublayers introduced in Noam Shazeerâ€™s paper differ from the traditional feed-forward layers in transformer architectures 
# by using Gated Linear Units (GLU) or its variants in place of traditional activation functions like ReLU or GELU.

# Traditional Transformer Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
